              The Story Behind Eatsy
            </h2>
            <p>
              Eatsy began with a simple yet common problem: figuring out what to
              make for dinner. As someone who loves cooking, designing and
              coding - I wanted to work on a project that could incorporate all
              three and make meal planning easier and more enjoyable.
              <br /><br />
              While working on Eatsy, I dove deep into front-end development, experimenting
              with new technologies and focusing on making the site as user-friendly
              as possible. It’s been a rewarding journey of learning and creating
              something that I hope will bring a bit more ease and inspiration to
              your meal planning!
