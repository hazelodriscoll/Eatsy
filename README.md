## How I Managed the Project

For this project, I used GitHub to handle everything, including code, documentation, and task management. I used the following:

- **Feature and Bug Fix Branches**: I created separate branches for adding new features and fixing bugs. When ready, then merged these branches to main.

- **Regular Commits**: I made regular updates to the code with clear messages explaining what I changed.

- **GitHub Issues and Projects**: I used GitHub’s “Issues” to keep track of tasks and “Projects” to setup a Kanban board and manage them.

These practices helped me keep the project on track and organized throughout its development.
